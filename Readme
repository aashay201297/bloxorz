#		     About The Game 			  #
###########################################################

- The motive of the game is to put the cuboidal block in the
  destined hole in the game.

- The block can move by rolling over it's sides or by tumbling
  over when it is standing.

- The block takes two tiles spaces when lying down and a single 
  tile space when standing.

- Normal Tiles: Coloured Yellow. You can move anyway you like
  on these tiles. 

- Fragile Tiles: Coloured Green. The block should be only lying down
  to be standing on a fragile tile else it will break.

- Simple Switch: Marked with Orange Triangle. The block can be in any 
  position above this switch to activate the switch. Some new
  tiles can come up with this switch.

- Hard Switch: Marked with Orange Squares. The block needs to be
  in standing position upon this switch to activate it. New
  tiles will come up once you stand on this switch.

- The block should always be on the board as a whole. Even if half
  of the block goes out of the board, it will fall.

- To put the block in the winning hole, block should be in the
  standing position to get into the hole.
